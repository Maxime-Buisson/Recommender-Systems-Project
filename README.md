## ðŸš€ Report <a name="report"></a>
The aim of the project is to build a recommender system to recommend a list of movies for two users.
1. The data sets used are:
    - MovieLens: ml-1m
    - IMDB: name.basic and title.basic

2. For our feature engineering, we created a merge DataFrame combining both datasets. But in our recommender system, we won't be needing all the information present in all the datasets because we'll be doing a collaborative filtering model so we won't be needing the extra metadata. We chose a SVD approach with Simon Funk's algorithm because it handles well sparse data. 

3. The model I chosed to build is a collaborative filtering based on SVD.
at first we did a simple matrix decomposition and obtained a reconstructed matrix that represents ratings of the movies but our data being extremely sparse we can't go foward with solely a regular SVD. We opted for Simon Funk's SVD algorithm that by using factorizing a matrix into two other ones and using gradient descent to find optimal values of features and weights we find create a model that has a RMSE of 0.86 which is sufficient for our recommendation system.

4. For our recommendation system we did the following:
    - predict the rating for movies for User1 and User2
    - get only the movies which User1 and User2 have not seen
    - do the average of both ratings to create a `couple score`
    - select the top n movies with the highest `couple score`
    
    this was the taken approach. Initialy we were thinking to make a sort of new user were we could combine both ratings and make a prediction but this doesn't represent well our two users.

5. For our model, we used a simple Root mean square error (RMNS) for each users and the predicted ratings. We can believe that this metric is enough for evaluating our model since we combine the predictions of two users. So the error on the prediction is sufficient and represents well the error of our model.
